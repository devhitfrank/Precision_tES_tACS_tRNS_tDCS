<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This device was constructed as a result of the sponsorship of
reddit user /u/nzt49.</p>
<p>The instructable here is an extension of my previous work,
"<a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Transcranial-Electrical-Stimulator-Arduino-Compati/">Transcranial
Electrical Stimulator, Arduino Compatible</a>", and uses two
copies of the previously designed circuit board in order to produce a
two-channel transcranial electrical stimulator. This device's code
can be readily modified to provide arbitrary dual-channel stimulation
outputs. With the code provided here, this stimulator will enable you
to replicate the stimulation montages of the following studies:</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: The device here, if improperly constructed, can cause
bodily harm ranging from headache to seizures to death. If correctly
constructed, this device may still cause seizures in susceptible
individuals, and it operates by changing the user's mind in a manner
that may be permanent. The user may find these potentially permanent
neurological changes to be undesirable, and users must be aware of,
and willfully accept, this risk. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5048227/">Croatian
Medical Journal has published a paper claiming that it's unethical to
release instructions like this</a> (my design is citation #10), but
since I am otherwise a puny human, and in this specific field I have
an asymmetrical advantage vs. constraining institutions, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rtms/comments/7ogwsg/opensource_rtms_device_status_update/">I
seek to press forward</a>. All this mind control technology can
probably be abused in profoundly disturbing ways; I am uncertain that
its existence is a clearly good thing, but since the genie is already
out of the bottle ... I would rather that everyone have access to
these tools instead of only centralized institutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>DESIGN REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="twotacs_ii.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="twotacs_iii.jpg"></p>
<p>Extracted and reorganized by stimulation type from the methods of
the papers listed in the introduction,</p>
<p>"Spatial Working Memory in Humans Depends on Theta and High Gamma
Synchronization in the Prefrontal Cortex" ; 
</p>
<p>"Externally induced frontoparietal synchronization modulates
network dynamics and enhances working memory performance" ; 
</p>
<p>"The influence of transcranial alternating current stimulation
(tACS) on fluid intelligence: An fMRI study"</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Single channel modes: some of the stimulation montages only use a
single channel. To support these stimulation montages, only a simple
constant-current AC output is required, at the frequencies 5Hz and
6Hz, with an intensity of 1mA or 1.5mA.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Single-Frequency Alternating Current Stimulation: SF-6</p>
<p>A continuous, sinusoidal 6 Hz stimulation was applied at an
intensity of 1 mA peak to baseline.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Single-channel theta frequency (5Hz) stimulation<br/>
Stimulation
waveform was sinusoidal without DC offset and a 0 degree relative phase.
The impedance level was kept below 10 kOhm throughout the entire
stimulation period. The applied oscillating currents corresponded to
mean theta frequency in previous studies (Jacobson, Goren, Lavidor, &
Levy, 2012; 5 Hz); current intensity was 1500 μA.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Multichannel modes with one channel modulated by the other: the
'cross-frequency' stimulation uses one underlying low-frequency sine
wave at 6Hz and another high-frequency sine wave at 40Hz-200Hz, with
the high-frequency wave only being present during either the positive
half-cycle or the negative half-cycle of the low-frequency wave.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Cross-Frequency Alternating Current Stimulation: CF-"Theta-Gamma
Frequencies"</p>
<p>This stimulation consisted of two superimposed components:
continuous slow wave, and repetitive bursts of fast oscillations. The
slow component was the 6 Hz sinusoidal stimulation with 0.6-mA
peak-to-baseline current for every corresponding condition. The fast
component frequency was 40 Hz (condition CF-6,40t), 80 Hz (CF-6,80t
and CF-6,80p), 100 Hz (CF-6,100p), 140 Hz (CF-6,140p), or 200 Hz
(CF-6,200p) at 0.4 mA peak to baseline. Bursts were synchronized with
the continuous wave and lasted for 50 ms during every trough
(CF-6,80t) or peak (CF-6,40p, CF-6,80p, CF-6,100p, CF-6,140p, and
CF-6,200p). Temporally accurate fusing of the components was achieved
by dedicated hardware and monitored with an oscilloscope.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Bursts mode</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Gamma-Burst Stimulation: Bursts</p>
<p>Bursts of 80 Hz alternating current were applied for 50 ms six
times per s with a current of 0.4 mA peak to baseline with positive
or negative DC offset (Bursts+ or Bursts-). Total intensity was
equal to 1 mA peak to baseline. These stimulation conditions were
designed to reproduce the conditions CF-6,80t and CF-6,80p without
the continuous slow-wave component.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Multichannel modes with a specific phase relationship between the
two channels:</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>In- and anti-phase theta frequency (6 Hz) stimulation</p>
<p>Stimulation was sinusoidal, 6 Hz frequency, peak-to-peak amplitude
of 1000 μA, and no DC offset.</p>
<p>TACS was delivered in two different conditions: (1) Synchronous
condition (0 degree) - Electrodes F4 and P4 with a 0 degree phase offset and
return electrode at T8; (2) Desynchronous condition (180 degree) - same
montage as in the 'synchronous' condition, but electrodes F4 and
P4 had a 180degree phase offset.</p>

<p>The .zip file provided is compiled for<a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html">
SeeedStudio Fusion PCB </a>specifically! You'll need to go to the
github repository <a href="https://github.com/quicksilv3rflash/Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS/">[LINK
TO ASSOCIATED GITHUB REPOSITORY]</a> to get the actual .brd files and
reprocess them if you need gerbers (PCB design files) for a different
manufacturing service. I'm only giving instructions for purchasing
though Seeed here because they're the service I used for the tested
prototypes, and also the cheapest I've found that doesn't noticeably
cut quality. 
</p>
<p>Ordering instructions: 
</p>
<p>You'll be ordering from <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html">SeeedStudio
Fusion PCB</a>. These people have a two-week maximum manufacturing
turnaround time but a really slow shipping carrier. After making an
account with SeeedStudio (sorry), you need to submit a set of gerber
files to be manufactured, packaged in a .zip. I've already assembled
the .zip for you, it's embedded at the bottom this step,
seeed_fusionpcb_gerber.zip. Download it. This .zip file is also on
<a href="https://github.com/quicksilv3rflash/Precision_tES_tACS_tRNS_tDCS/">github</a>.
On the order page linked, click the button labeled "Add your
gerber file", browse to your downloaded copy of
seeed_fusionpcb_gerber.zip, and upload it. Select the following
options: 
</p>
<p>MATERIAL: FR4-TG130 (or whatever says FR4 as the first three
characters) 
</p>
<p>LAYERS: 2 LAYERS DIMENSIONS: (manually enter or click the blue
autofill measurements to the right of "DIMENSIONS") 56.5 *
56.5 (mm) 
</p>
<p>PCB QTY: 10 (might as well, there's no price break for 5...) 
</p>
<p>PANELIZED PCBS: 1

<p>...then click "add to cart", and then the little cart
icon in the top-right, and then it's a standard online retailer
checkout. It's highly recommended to get expedited shipping. (Isn't
ordering boards fun? Look at all the miscellaneous units up there!
Ounces (per square foot, implicitly), millimeters, mils... why choose
between the imperial and metric system when you could make an even
more convoluted global standard setup that drags in units from both?)

<p>===============================</p>
<p>Section 3: device power components (Total: $12.96, from various
suppliers around ebay as of 2017-01-18) These device power supply
components are standard blocks that have been cloned by multiple
suppliers. They're cheap, common, identical from multiple
manufacturers and sellers, and they appear reliable (never had one
break yet), but I can't find the "proper" names and model
numbers for them. So I recommend simply searching for the quoted
phrases below on eBay.</p>

<p>================================</p>
<p>SOLDERING THE BOARDS</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="twotacs_v.jpg"></p>
<p>This step is directly copied from <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Transcranial-Electrical-Stimulator-Arduino-Compati/#step10">the
instructable I wrote immediately after designing the tACS board used
here, which describes the operation of the board's circuit itself in
detail</a>.</p>
<p>This board might look intimidating if you haven't done much SMD
soldering work, but it's not actually that hard*, so don't worry!
<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1Q2XTPf2Q8xRjNiU3hGeVhER0E/view?pli=1">Here's
a guide to SMD soldering</a>, also attached at the bottom of this
step.</p>
<p>*As long as your iron is temperature controlled, you get pretty
much infinite do-overs. You *will* bridge the pins, unless you're
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUyetZ5RtPs">this person</a>,
and that's OK! Simply remove the solder bridges with a desoldering
braid afterwards.</p>
<p>All LEDs are aligned cathode down, and all chips with 6 or more
pins are aligned with pin 1 in the top left, in the view shown above.
Everything else's alignment is either obvious (3 pins and only fits
one way) or doesn't matter (resistors and nonpolarized ceramic
capacitors). I designed this board with ease of building in mind. 
</p>
<p>[ -- Used in step -- ] 
</p>
<p>Temperature controlled soldering iron (recommendation for Sn/Pb
solder: set to 320 C for soldering, 375 C for desoldering with the
desoldering braid)</p>
<p>Flux pen</p>
<p>Desoldering braid</p>
<p>Tweezers</p>
<p>60/40 or 63/37 Sn/Pb solder, fine diameter, rosin core</p>
<p>Circuit boards and tiny components previously ordered from Mouser
and Seeed 
</p>
<p>[ -- Procedure -- ]</p>
<p>Your soldering process for multipin surface mount chips will look
like this: 
</p>
<p>1. Use flux pen to coat pads on board 
</p>
<p>2. Blob solder on a corner pad 
</p>
<p>3. Grab chip with tweezers and align on circuit board pads while
holding iron tip to the corner pad that got extra solder 
</p>
<p>4. Remove soldering iron tip, check chip/pad alignment, GOTO 3 if
chip is misaligned 
</p>
<p>5. Melt solder into the general vicinity of the pins/pads. Some
pins will probably be bridged. 
</p>
<p>6. Raise iron temperature, remove solder bridges with desoldering
braid 
</p>
<p><a href="../tACS/smd_soldering.pdf">smd_soldering.pdf</a></p>
<p>7. Reexamine solder joints for bridging, GOTO 5 if bridged (adding
a little solder to a bridge so it's convex makes it easier to remove
with the desoldering braid)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>ASSEMBLING THE DEVICE</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="twotacs_vi.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="twotacs_vii.jpg"></p>
<p>Begin by attaching two of the battery holders in series. The
larger, 8-cell battery will ultimately power the Arduino and screen.
Both the 8-cell and 4-cell batteries must have their positive output
leads first routed through the power switch and then connected to
panel voltmeters. The batteries should be replaced when there is less
than 1v per cell.</p>
<p>The 4-cell battery powers only a single XL6009 boost module whose
output must be set to 36V.</p>
<p>The 8-cell battery powers two modules, an XL6009 boost module
whose output must be set to 36V, and an LM2596 buck module whose
output must be set to 7.1V.</p>
<p>The two XL6009 boost modules' outputs are wired in series, with
the center point being connected to ISO_+0V on each tACS circuit
board, and the endpoints connected to ISO_+36V and ISO_-36V on each
tACS circuit board.</p>
<p>The LM2596 buck module's 7.1V output goes to Vin on the Arduino
Uno, into which the VMA203 keypad/screen module is plugged.</p>
<p>The Arduino's +5v output and GND are connected to each tACS
board's +SPI_VCC and +SPI_GND terminals.</p>
<p>The Arduino's digital 11 output should be wired to SPI_MOSI of
both tACS boards, the Arduino's digital 13 output should be wired to
the SPI_SCK of both boards. Arduino digital 2 is connected to Channel
A board's SPI_*CS, Arduino digital 3 is connected Channel B board's
SPI_*CS.</p>
<p>The +HUMAN_I_OUT terminals of each board must be routed through a
DPDT switch which may disconnect them from the output, and then past
another switch which may short them together if desired, before being
connected to the red wires of the output electrode leads. The
+HUMAN_GND_OUT terminals of each board are connected together (though
they already are through the power supply, note that severing this
connection will not electrically disconnect the device grounds), then
connected to the black wires of the output electrode leads.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>Using the Interface</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="twotacs_viii.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="twotacs_ix.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="twotacs_x.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="twotacs_xi.jpg"></p>
<p>The device has three switches:</p>
<p>Power on / off:</p>
<p>Turns the device on or off.</p>
<p>Outputs on / off:</p>
<p>Turns the outputs on or off.</p>
<p>Outputs connected / separate:</p>
<p>Electrically connects both signal (red) lines. Used to connect
both channel outputs to a single signal electrode, superimposing the
channels' outputs.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>The interface screen has six buttons under it:</p>
<p>RST:</p>
<p>Resets the entire device.</p>
<p>SELECT:</p>
<p>Cycles through the three screens, Channel A, Channel B, and Mode.</p>
<p>LEFT: 
</p>
<p>Cycles the pointer ( ">" or "<" )
through the fields on the current screen. The pointer indicates which
field can be changed by the UP or DOWN keys. On some mode screens,
this pointer can disappear from view, but it can be found again by
pressing LEFT or RIGHT repeatedly.</p>
<p>RIGHT: 
</p>
<p>Cycles the pointer ( ">" or "<" )
through the fields on the current screen. The pointer indicates which
field can be changed by the UP or DOWN keys. On some mode screens,
this pointer can disappear from view, but it can be found again by
pressing LEFT or RIGHT repeatedly.</p>
<p>UP:</p>
<p>If pressed once, increases by one the field indicated by ">"
or "<". If held down, rapidly increases the field
indicated by ">" or "<".</p>
<p>DOWN:</p>
<p>If pressed once, decreases by one the field indicated by ">"
or "<". If held down, rapidly decreases the field
indicated by ">" or "<".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>================================</p>
<p>Software Operation, Normal Mode</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="twotacs_xii.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="twotacs_xiii.jpg"></p>
<p>In normal mode, both channels are always on at the set
frequencies, amplitudes, and offsets.</p>
<p>Normal mode is used to replicate the following montages:</p>
<p>Single-Frequency Alternating Current Stimulation: SF-6 
</p>
<p>A continuous, sinusoidal 6 Hz stimulation was applied at an
intensity of 1 mA peak to baseline. 
</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>For single-frequency alternating current stimulation, the "channel
<br/>
connect" switch should be set to DISCONNECT THE OUTPUTS,
and only channel A needs to be connected to output electrodes.
Channel A should be set to 6Hz, 1.0mA AC, 0.0mA DC.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Single-channel theta frequency (5Hz) stimulation 
</p>
<p>Stimulation waveform was sinusoidal without DC offset and a 0°
relative phase. Current intensity was 1500 μA.</p>
<p>{editor's note: how do you have "relative phase" with
only one channel? <br/>
relative to what? This part of these
published methods I did not know how to replicate.}</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>For single-channel theta frequency (5Hz) stimulation, the "channel
connect" switch should be set to DISCONNECT THE OUTPUTS, and
only channel A needs to be connected to output electrodes. Channel A
should be set to 5Hz, 1.5mA AC, 0.0mA DC.</p>

<p>In bursts mode, both channels turn on for msON milliseconds, then
off for msOFF milliseconds. The burst frequency is 1000/(msON+msOFF),
or 6Hz for the values shown, 50ms and 117ms.</p>
<p>Bursts mode is used to replicate the following stimulation
montage:</p>
<p>Gamma-Burst Stimulation: Bursts 
</p>
<p>Bursts of 80 Hz alternating current were applied for 50 ms six
times per s with a current of 0.4 mA peak to baseline with positive
or negative DC offset (Bursts+ or Bursts−). Total intensity was
equal to 1 mA peak to baseline. These stimulation conditions were
designed to reproduce the conditions CF-6,80t and CF-6,80p without
the continuous slow-wave component.</p>
<p>Only channel A needs to be connected to electrodes to replicate
this montage. Channel B should be left disconnected, and the "connect
channels" switch must be set to CHANNELS SEPARATE. The device
should be set to BURSTS mode, and channel A must be set to the
following: 80Hz, 0.4mA AC, and 0.6mA DC for Bursts+, or -0.6mA DC for
Bursts-.</p>

<p>In phase set mode, the frequency of channel B is forced to be the
same as the frequency of channel A. The phase relationship is set
such that the outputs' values are given by the functions:</p>
<p>Channel A = AmplitudeA*sin(A_degrees) + OffsetA</p>
<p>Channel B = AmplitudeB*sin(A_degrees + PHASE_SHIFT) + OffsetB</p>
<p>Phase set mode is used to replicate the following stimulation
montage:</p>
<p>In- and anti-phase theta frequency (6 Hz) stimulation</p>
<p>Stimulation was sinusoidal, 6 Hz frequency, peak-to-peak amplitude
of 1000 μA, and no DC offset. TACS was delivered in two different
conditions: (1) Synchronous condition (0°) - Electrodes F4 and P4
with a 0° phase offset and return electrode at T8; (2) Desynchronous
condition (180°) - same montage as in the ‘synchronous’
condition, but electrodes F4 and P4 had a 180° phase offset.</p>
<p>Both channels need to be connected to electrodes to replicate this
montage. The "connect channels" switch must be set to
CHANNELS SEPARATE. The device should be set to PHASE SET mode, and
channel A must be set to the following: 6Hz, 1.0mA AC, 0.0mA DC.
Channel B must be set to 1.0mA AC, 0.0mA DC (its frequency will
automatically be set to match channel A). Within the MODE:PHASE SET
screen, B_DEG=A_DEG must be +180 for desynchronous condition, and 0
for synchronous condition.</p>

<p>Channel A is always on, but channel B is only turned on during
channel A's Peak or Trough (user set). Channel B is turned on for
50ms in the setup shown. Channel B's on-time can be changed from the
50ms value through the user interface if desired.</p>
<p>Phase set mode is used to replicate the following stimulation
montage:</p>
<p>Cross-Frequency Alternating Current Stimulation: CF-“Theta-Gamma
Frequencies”</p>
<p>This stimulation consisted of two superimposed components:
continuous slow wave, and repetitive bursts of fast oscillations. The
slow component was the 6 Hz sinusoidal stimulation with 0.6-mA
peak-to-baseline current for every corresponding condition. The fast
component frequency was 40 Hz (condition CF-6,40t), 80 Hz (CF-6,80t
and CF-6,80p), 100 Hz (CF-6,100p), 140 Hz (CF-6,140p), or 200 Hz
(CF-6,200p) at 0.4 mA peak to baseline. Bursts were synchronized with
the continuous wave and lasted for 50 ms during every trough
(CF-6,80t) or peak (CF-6,40p, CF-6,80p, CF-6,100p, CF-6,140p, and
CF-6,200p).</p>
<p>Only one channel needs to be connected to electrodes to duplicate
this montage. The "connect outputs" switch should be set to
OUTPUTS CONNECTED. MODE should be set to CROSS-FREQ, PEAK or TROU as
desired, 50ms. Channel A should be set to 6Hz, 0.6mA AC, 0.0mA DC.
Channel B should be set to 0.4mA AC, 0.0mA DC, and 40, 80, 100, 140,
or 200 Hz as desired.</p>
