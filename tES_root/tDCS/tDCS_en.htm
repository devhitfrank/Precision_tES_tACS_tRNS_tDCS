<p>I was surprised and pleased to learn that human enhancement
technologies not only exist, but are within the reach of the basic
electronic hobbyist. This instructable is (of course) for educational

<p>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a method of
external neural modulation that uses a small current run through the
brain in order to alter cortical excitability. The details of the
mechanism of action and exact enhancements possible are beyond the
scope of this article, but <a href="http://www.fisherwallace.com/">you
can examine commercially available products</a>, and look at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754807/">safety
data</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212000140">ethical

<p>================================</p>
<p>CIRCUIT PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION</p>
<p>================================</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="tdcs_theory.jpg"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you don't wish to consider the theoretical basis for the
operation of this circuit, skip this step.<br/>
<br/>
The circuit
shown is a regulated current sink. You may find it a useful building
block in your future projects. It regulates the current through R[L],
preventing it from exceeding a set value. This circuit doesn't have
active drive capacity, though, and so V[DRIVE] must be large enough
to drive the desired current through R[L].<br/>
<br/>
The current
through R[L] is equal to I[C].&nbsp; I[C] is roughly equal to (
V[REF] - (V[BE] of T1) ) / R[LIM] .<br/>
<br/>
To see where this
equation originates, begin by noting that the sum of the voltages
around the loop formed by V[REF], the base-emitter junction of T1,
and R[LIM] must be zero (by Kirchhoff's voltage law):<br/>
V[REF] -
V[BE] - V[RLIM] = 0<br/>
so<br/>
V[RLIM] = V[REF] - V[BE] .<br/>
<br/>
The
current through R[LIM] (also known as I[E]) is defined by Ohm's law,
and we can substitute using the previous equation:<br/>
I[E] =
V[RLIM] / R[LIM] = (V[REF] - V[BE] ) / R[LIM] .<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring
the base current,<br/>
I[C] = I[E] ,<br/>
so the current through the
load resistor is approximately defined by<br/>
I[LOAD] = I[C] =
(V[REF] - V[BE] ) / R[LIM] .<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to include the
effects of the base current of the transistor, you must also factor
in the current gain of the transistor, h[FE].<br/>
Viewing the
transistor as a node, by Kirchhoff's current law,<br/>
0 = I[C] +
I[B] - I[E]<br/>
so<br/>
I[B] = I[E] - I[C] .<br/>
<br/>
We know that
h[FE] is the factor we can multiply by I[B] to find our I[C].
Thus,<br/>
I[B] * h[FE] = I[C] .<br/>
<br/>
Substituting for I[B]
from a previous equation,<br/>
(I[E] - I[C]) * h[FE] = I[C]
.<br/>
<br/>
Solving for I[C],<br/>
I[C] = I[E] - (I[E] /(1 + h[FE] )
) ,<br/>
and since I[E] = (V[REF] - V[BE] ) / R[LIM] ,<br/>
the exact
equation then becomes:<br/>
<br/>
I[C] = ((V[REF] - V[BE] ) / R[LIM]
) - (((V[REF] - V[BE] ) / R[LIM] ) / (1 + h[FE] ) ) .</p>

<p>This is the schematic of a working 2mA current supply that may be
used for tDCS. It is based on the transistor regulator described in
the previous step. Parts were added to allow on/off functionality, on
state indication, and redundant safety measures.<br/>

Wires
and gel electrodes are easiest to find sold for TENS devices, but
will allow tDCS, though only in areas that are hairless. There are
other options, though, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tDCS/comments/4qx8ic/psa_sticky_electrodes_and_skin_burns/">sponge
electrodes are less likely to cause electrode burns.</a></p>
<p>Original suggestion at the initial time of writing, the cheapest,
but can only be used over hairless skin and may be more likely to
cause skin irritation and minor damage:<br/>
W1: electrode leads
(such as these TENS leads)</p>
<p>A search for &quot;TENS electrode leads&quot; will find the
appropriate type</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=TENS+leads">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=searc...</a></p>
<p>E1,E2: gel electrode pads (also sold for TENS units)</p>
<p>Search for &quot;TENS gel electrodes&quot;, I recommend 2&quot; x
2&quot; square gel electrodes</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=TENS+electrodes&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3ATENS+electrodes">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=searc...</a></p>
<p>New suggestion 1: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/tDCS-Medical-Sponge-1pair/291406222763">sponge
electrodes that are compatible with 2mm pin connectors</a> instead of
gel electrodes. That's an ebay link, though, posted 2016-10-24, and
it may not remain live / I can't find any other sellers with 2mm
compatible sponge electrodes at the moment.</p>
<p>New suggestion 2: Banana plugs instead of TENS electrodes leads
and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amrex-3-x3-Electrode-Caputron/dp/B00SDLU6KM/">Amrex
sponge electrodes</a>. Those sponge electrodes are $20 each, though,
instead of $10 for a pair like new suggestion 1.</p>
<p>New suggestion 3: Someone who followed this design (Instructables username ElChevere) used spoons and kitchen sponges for electrodes. Of this I wholeheartedly approve, since it's probably the cheapest / most efficient way to get sponge electrodes with commonly available parts

Perfboard is best for assembling this circuit
permanently.<br/>
Hot-melt glue is useful for gluing wires in place
to prevent strain.</p>

<p>Once your device is constructed, you should test it before
adhering it to your head and torso and activating it. Check the
short-circuit output current with an ammeter. The value should be 2
mA +/- 10%.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun. Try to get better.<br/>
<br/>
Look
into <a href="http://www.neuroplustech.com/nootropics/piracetam_summary.html">piracetam</a>
but remember that it seems to work best when taken with supplemental
<a href="http://www.neuroplustech.com/nootropics/choline.html">choline</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Good
luck.</p>
